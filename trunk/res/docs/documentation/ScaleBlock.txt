{"Dilate or contract a signal in time and/or amplitude."}

!! *Parameters:*

*TimeScalingFactor:* {"Factor to be used in time scaling. If the value is setted to 1, no scaling will be applied to the time variable."}

*AmplitudeScalingFactor:* {"Factor to be used in amplitude scaling. If the value is setted to 1, no scaling will be applied to the amplitude variable."}

!! *Example:*

{"The following example shows an usage in C#."}

{code:c#}
var signal = new ImportFromTextBlock { Text = "1, 3, -2, 9, 4.5, -2, 4, 0" };
var block = new ScaleBlock
{
    TimeScalingFactor = 2,
    AmplitudeScalingFactor = 1.5
};

signal.ConnectTo(block);
signal.Execute();

Console.WriteLine(block.Output[0].ToString(0, ", "));
