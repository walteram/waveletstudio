{"Switch output between first input (A) and third input (B) based on value of second input or the threshold value, using the specified switch criteria.
For example, letâ€™s consider the following scenario:"}
{code:c#}
Signal A: 1, 3, 4, -4, 8, 3, 2, -10
Signal B: 3, -2, 4, -6, 7, 1, 4, 3
Threshold: 2
Switch Criteria: Select B when B is greater than threshold
{code:c#}
{"
The Switch Criteria is a parameter defining when the value of the signal B will be selected, instead of selecting the value of the signal A. The block will output a new signal with the folowing samples:"}
{code:c#}
3 3 4 -4 7 3 4 3
{code:c#}
{"
The #1 sample (3) was selected from signal B (the value from B is greater than the threshold);
The #2 sample (3) was selected from signal A (the value from B is not greater than the threshold);
The #3 sample (4) was selected from signal B (the value from B is greater than the threshold);
and so on."}

!! *Parameters:*

*SwitchCriteria:* {"Defines when the value of the signal B will be selected, instead of selecting the value of the signal A"}
> BIsGreaterThanThreshold - Select B when B > threshold, otherwise select A
> BIsLessThanThreshold - Select B when B < threshold, otherwise select A
> BIsGreaterOrEqualsThanThreshold - Select B when B >= threshold, otherwise select A
> BIsLessOrEqualsThanThreshold - Select B when B <= threshold, otherwise select A

*StaticThreshold:* {"Assign the switch threshold that determines which input the block passes to the output. You can use this parameter to set a static value, or use the second input of the block to define a signal as a threshold."}

!! *Inputs:*

0 - Signal A
1 - Threshold signal(optional)
2 - Signal B

!! *Outputs:*

This block outputs a single signal or a signal list of switched samples.

!! *Example:*

{"The following example shows an usage in C#."}

{code:c#}
var signal1 = new ImportFromTextBlock { Text = "1, 3, 4, -4, 8, 3, 2, -10" };
var signal2 = new ImportFromTextBlock { Text = "3, -2, 4, -6, 7, 1, 4, 3" };
var block = new SwitchBlock
{
    StaticThreshold = 2,
    SwitchCriteria = WaveMath.SwitchCriteriaEnum.BIsGreaterThanThreshold
};
signal1.OutputNodes[0].ConnectTo(block.InputNodes[0]);
signal2.OutputNodes[0].ConnectTo(block.InputNodes[2]);
signal1.Execute();
signal2.Execute();

Console.WriteLine(block.OutputNodes[0].Object.ToString(0));
//Output: 3 3 4 -4 7 3 4 3
{code:c#}
