{"Generates a Ramp signal using the following function:
y(t) = A * (t - t0) + D     ∀ t >= t0, t <= t1
                    y(t) = D                    ∀ t < t0
                    y(t) = D + x(t1)            ∀ t > t1 | D  (if ReturnToZero parameter is true)
Where:
A := amplitude
D := offset
t0 := ramp start
t1 := ramp finish
This block has no inputs."}

!! *Parameters:*

*Amplitude:* {"Amplitude of the ramp. Default value is 1."}

*Offset:* {"Offset of the signal in the y axis. Default value is 0."}

*Start:* {"Start of the signal in the time. Default value is 0."}

*Finish:* {"Finish of the signal in the time. Default value is 1."}

*RampStart:* {"Start of the ramp in the time. Default value is 0."}

*RampFinish:* {"Finish of the ramp in the time. Default value is 1."}

*SamplingRate:* {"Sampling rate used on signal generation. Default value is 32768 (32KHz)."}

*IgnoreLastSample:* {"If true, the last sample is not included in the created signal. Default value is false."}

*ReturnToZero:* {"If true, the value will return to 0 at the finish of the ramp. Default value is true."}

!! *Example:*

{"In this example we create a signal in a ramp shape. The signal starts at 0s and ends at 16s. The ramp starts at 3s and ends at 8s. The sampling rate is 1 (1Hz). The amplitude of the ramp is 1 and the signal offset is 1. The signal will return to the offset value (1) after the end of the ramp (8s). The last sample of the signal is included."}
