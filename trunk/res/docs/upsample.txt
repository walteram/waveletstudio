Resample input at higher rate by inserting zeros between samples.

<h2>Parameters:</h2>

<strong>Factor (uint):</strong>
Defines the upsample factor used in the block or how many samples will be inserted between samples of the signal. Default value is 2 (insert 1 sample).

<h2>Inputs:</h2>
This block has only one input: a single signal or a signal list.

<h2>Outputs:</h2>
This block outputs a single signal or a signal list of downsampled data.

<h2>Usage:</h2>

The following example shows how to create this block using C# 4.

<pre lang="csharp">//Creates a sample signal with 4 samples
var signalBlock = new ImportFromTextBlock { Text = "14, 20, 11, 41" };

//UpSample block to add 2 samples between each other
var block = new UpSampleBlock { Factor = 3 };

//Connect and execute blocks
signalBlock.ConnectTo(block);
signalBlock.Execute();

Console.WriteLine(block.OutputNodes[0].Object[0].ToString(0));

//Output: 14 0 0 20 0 0 11 0 0 41</pre>
